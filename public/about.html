<p>I never thought I would be interested in programming, but here I am! In fact, the programming language is very interesting. I am a linguist by education, specifically a translator of English and Russian languages, so the idea of ​​​​working with a new language does not scare me.</p>
<p>So far I have created only three projects: a list of films, a birthday invitation and this portfolio itself. However, I am one hundred percent sure that this is just the first brick!</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to wish good luck to everyone who reads this and also express my deep gratitude to the magnificent and cheerful Angela!</p>
