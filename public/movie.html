 <h1>The Best Movies According to Diana</h1>
 <h2>My top 5 movies for all moods</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>#1 The Deep House</h3>
<p>A good horror about two YouTubers who specialize in underwater exploration.</p>
<h3>#2 The Queen's Gambit</h3>
<p>Set during the Cold War era, orphaned chess prodigy Beth Harmon struggles with addiction in a quest to become the greatest chess player in the world. It's a TV Show, has only 7 episodes but definitely worth to watch!</p>
<h3>#3 American Pie (all parts!)</h3>
<p>A riotous and raunchy exploration of the most eagerly anticipated -- and most humiliating -- rite of adulthood, known as losing one's virginity. In this hilarious lesson in life, love and libido, a group of friends, fed up with their well-deserved reputations as sexual no-hitters, decide to take action.
    <p>In addition to life jokes, the movies also contain mind-blowing music.</p>
    <h3>#4 Seven Psychopaths</h3>
    <p>This is a dark, screwball comedy-drama that constantly surprises.</p>
    <h3>#5 The Neon Demon</h3>
    <p>If you give yourself over to The Neon Demon, let yourself be completely immersed in its hypnotic fever dream, it will stick with you, burrowed in your subconscious. It truly is a work of art.</p>
